        <h2 class="text-center">What is the financial system?</h2>
        <p class="text-center p-2">
            The financial system is a complex network of institutions, markets, and instruments that facilitate the flow of funds (money to be paid or received) between savers and borrowers. It is responsible for directing savings to their most productive use, mobilising capital for investment, and allocating risk.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center p-2">
            The financial system consists of several key components, including:

                        The central bank is responsible for setting monetary policy, regulating financial institutions, and maintaining stability in the financial system - during the 2008 financial crisis, the central bank provided emergency loans to banks to prevent a complete collapse of the financial system.

            What is banking?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-center">
            Banks play a critical role in the financial system by accepting customer deposits and lending to borrowers. This intermediation process helps mobilise savings and allocate capital to the most productive use. For example, a small business owner who needs a loan to expand their operations may go to a bank to obtain financing. The bank uses the deposits it has received from other customers to provide the loan to the small business owner.

            What is insurance?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-center">
            Insurance companies provide another important function in the financial system by helping to manage risk. For example, homeowners may purchase insurance to protect their homes from damage or loss due to a natural disaster. The insurance company pools the premiums it receives from many policyholders to provide a cushion against potential losses.

    <div class="container-fluid bg-dark text-light p-5">
        <p class="text-center p-2">
            In conclusion, the financial system is a complex and dynamic system that plays a critical role in the economy by channelling savings into investment, mobilising capital, and allocating risk. Financial institutions, markets, and instruments are key system components, and the central bank is responsible for maintaining stability and promoting economic growth. From an individual perspective, understanding the financial system is also important for personal financial literacy, informed decision-making, and promoting economic stability.
